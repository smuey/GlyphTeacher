# GlyphTeacher
App to help people learn the (currently) 104 glyphs and their meaning from the AR-game Ingress

Goal of the app is going to be teaching the patterns and their meaning in the game. It will be allowed to use either the official meaning as provided by Niantic, or give each glyph a self-chosen name

This application will be available both as a PhoneGapp-app and a website (so people can choose which version they prefer)
